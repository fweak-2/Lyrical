Time took the pain but then nothing grew back in its place
So I watered it with whiskey, spoken tongues at his grave
You’d think the devils on his way the way I cycle through plagues
A ballerina in a box for the spiral I made
I go around in circles and I cycle through days
In a city full of sirens and black tidalling waves
I swim out past the breakers till it sparkles and fades until the stars are clear as ever and they're screaming my name

I’m so dead if I died I wouldn't notice
Pull up at The Case in the Uber Ford Focus
All I see is red and I feel like Moses
Jesus on my neck, Jesus on my neck x2
Jesus on my speed dial right after all the demons

Fighting them in levels, final boss will be the ceiling
I’m ignoring every call might as well of got a pager
I’m only showing up to papers so man fuck you and your rager
Another face from a bad dream
A name I wrote on paper set to flame and then swallow because the sacrifice was safer
Another stranger that I smile out while I’m out by a mill
Where I’m a name on a credit card of which I can't pay the bill

I’m so dead if I died I wouldn't notice
Pull up at The Case in the Uber Ford Focus
All I see is red and I feel like Moses
Jesus on my neck, Jesus on my neck x2

I don't need nobody when that shit pops off
You all don't like the way I’m going you can get dropped off
All the blood that's on my hands can never get washed off
I got fanciful up on you like brap bop bop
I don't need nobody when that shit pops off
You all don't like the way I’m going you can get dropped off
All the blood that's on my hands can never get washed off
I got fanciful up on you like brap bop bop

I’m so dead if I died I wouldn't notice
Pull up at The Case in the Uber Ford Focus
All I see is red and I feel like Moses
Jesus on my neck, Jesus on my neck x2
